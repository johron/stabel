## TODO
- [ ] Rewrite in itself
- [x] Change target to llvm ir
- [ ] FUnctions are not working as intended, stack is not "global". The values need to be passed to the next function and stuff
- [ ] Implement more data types: strings, floats. Upgrade the stack to store pointers and then translate them to correct type
