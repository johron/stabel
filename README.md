# Zelkel

## TODO
- [ ] Only include code that is used
- [ ] Standard functions like println and print need to be thought and done about
    - Remove hard coded standard functions
- [x] Variable definitions are a little bugged can't perform math on them
- [ ] Parser doesnt like to have big expressions with parentheses in function call arguments
- [ ] Parser must make sure expression value_type is same as the variable value_type
- [ ] Reassignable variables
- [ ] If statements
- [ ] While loops
- [ ] Global variables
- [ ] Tables, Lists
- [ ] Requiring other files, libraries: standard
    - Tokenize, parse, generate this zelkel file and combine them:
      maybe combine the zelkel code into one and compile that
- [ ] Rewrite in itself
- [ ] Make sure every function has a return
