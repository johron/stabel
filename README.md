## TODO
- [x] Figure out how to not have to specify return type in the return statement eg. `return: int 0`. Expressions must give their value_type, but i have no idea how to do this
- [ ] Global variables
- [ ] Rewrite in itself
- [x] Finish parser
- [ ] Make llvm emitter, codegen
- [ ] AST evaluator/checker
    - [ ] Makes sure every function has a return
    - [ ] Makes sure types are consistent, no mismatching types
    - [ ] Should be an optional thing, maybe?
